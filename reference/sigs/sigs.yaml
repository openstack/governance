    Ansible is an orchestration tool that is becoming increasingly common
    in usage across many parts of OpenStack.  There are a few deployment
    projects that are using it, alongside many of our CI systems.  This
    SIG exists to help create a colloborative space between different
    interested parties to share Ansible code under one group.
    It is also responsible of the OpenStack namespace on Ansible's galaxy.

    Formerly known as the API-WG, the API SIG scope is to improve the developer
    experience of API users by converging the OpenStack API to a consistent and
    pragmatic RESTful design. The working group creates guidelines that all
    OpenStack projects should follow for new development, and promotes
    convergence of new APIs and future versions of existing APIs.

    of Ironic and other OpenStack bare metal software. This will include
    marketing efforts like case studies of Ironic clusters in industry
    and academia, supporting integration of Ironic with projects like
    Airship and the Kubernetes Cluster API, coordinating presentations
    for industry events, developing documentation and tutorials,
    gathering feedback from the community on usage and feature gaps, and
    other broader community-facing efforts to encourage the adoption of
    Ironic as a bare-metal management tool.

    The Cloud Research SIG aims to bridge the gap between Academic
    Research in Cloud Computing and Technology projects within OpenStack.
    The group's purpose is to establish a collaboration space for Cloud
    researchers to discuss advancements in Cloud research and methodologies
    and to implement them in OpenStack. The group is also a communication
    space for researchers looking for guidance on how to evaluate their
    research work ( e.g., placement algorithms, model-free frameworks...etc.)
    in Openstack.

    within the OpenStack community. This SIG is directly intertwined with
    k8s-sig-openstack within the Kubernetes community, with the same sig

    The scope of the PowerVMStacker is to provide OpenStack support for the
    POWER CPU architecture on the PowerVM hypervisor.
    This enables support of Linux, AIX and IBM i for PowerVM systems.
    There are currently three supported components of the PowerVM driver -
    nova-powervm – Support for Nova use cases.
    ceilometer-powervm – Gathers instance/VM statistics.
    networking-powervm – An optional Neutron ML2 agent that supports PowerVM
    Shared Ethernet Adapters (SEAs). Users should utilize this if their environment
    requires Shared Ethernet. However, they may also use the standard Open vSwitch
    agent from the Neutron project to support advanced functions such as Security Groups,
    Quality of Service (QoS), overlay networks (VXLANs) and more.
