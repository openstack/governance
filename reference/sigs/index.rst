 OpenStack SIGs
================

The OpenStack SIGs (Special Interest Groups) are a form of
working group in OpenStack that is not directly responsible for
producing a part of the OpenStack software release. As such, they
do not require the same level of accountability that project teams
do.

SIGs are a good match for an activity that centers around a topic
or practice that spans all the community (developers, operators,
end users...), by forming a guild of people with a shared interest.

SIGs can own code repositories and produce software (independently
of the OpenStack software release itself). Contributions to a SIG
grant voting rights for the Technical Committee elections, in the
same way contributing to an OpenStack project team does.
