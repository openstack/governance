This repository contains OpenStack Technical Committee reference documents
and tracks official resolutions voted by the committee.

Directory structure:

    reference/
        Reference documents which need to be revised over time.
        Some motions will just directly result in reference doc changes.
    resolutions/
        When the motion does not result in a change in a reference doc, it
        can be expressed as a resolution.
        Those must be named YYYYMMDD-short-name with YYYYMMDD being the
        proposal date in order to allow basic sorting.

See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/TechnicalCommittee for details.
